# Camera-based object tracking for VR experiences

This project consists of two components:

- A python application that utilises [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to handle webcam data and produce an output of positional information of an untethered object (a ball!)
- A virtual reality application that takes the positional data of said object and renders it into the same position relative to the user, such that it can be interacted with
